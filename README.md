# Biomolecular electrostatics in virtual reality

Biomolecular electrostatic properties calculated by [APBS/PDB2PQR](http://www.poissonboltzmann.org/) can be visualized in two dimensions using a variety of platforms, including [VMD](https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/), [PyMOL](https://pymol.org/), and [Chimera](https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/).
Through collaboration with the [Baaden research group](http://www.baaden.ibpc.fr/), it is now possible to visualize electrostatics in their more natural three-dimensional environment through virtual reality (VR).
The new UnityMol-APBS software integrates [APBS/PDB2PQR](http://www.poissonboltzmann.org/) functionality with the UnityMol VR visualization framework. 
The VR version of this software is freely available for the Windows platform.
Desktop two-dimensional visualization with this software is possible on Windows, Mac OS X, or Linux.

Examples of UnityMol-APBS VR visualization are provided below and in the following videos:

## Getting UnityMol-APBS

As with APBS and PDB2PQR, we request that you [register your use of the software](http://eepurl.com/by4eQr) to help with its continued development through federal funding (NIH grant GM69702).

Due to limitations on virtual reality hardware/software support, UnityMol-APBS is currently only available on Windows.
This software can be downloaded from https://github.com/Electrostatics/VR/releases.

## Using UnityMol-APBS

This documentation assumes that UnityMol-APBS has been downloaded from the link above and that APBS/PDB2PQR](http://www.poissonboltzmann.org/) has been installed at `C:\APBS-PDB2PQR`.
